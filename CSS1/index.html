            <h2>The Dream Within</h2>
            <p>
                In the realm of dreams, we roam,
                Where the moon and stars doth comb,
                Silver whispers in the night,
                Guiding us through gentle light.

                Each slumber brings a new delight,
                A world of magic, pure and bright,
                Where dragons soar and mermaids play,
                And worries of the day decay.

                Across the skies, we take flight,
                Through clouds of cotton, soft and white,
                The dreamer's mind, a canvas grand,
                Painted by Morpheus' hand.

                But as the sun begins to rise,
                The dream within, it softly dies,
                And though we yearn for dreams anew,
                We bid the night a fond adieu.
