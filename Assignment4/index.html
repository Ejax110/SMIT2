        <h2>Chess Board</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Objective: <ul>
                    <li>The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king, placing it under direct attack with
                        no
                        possibility of escape.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Board Setup: <ul>
                    <li>The chessboard is an 8x8 grid consisting of 64 squares of alternating colors (usually light and
                        dark).</li>
                    <li>Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and
                        eight pawns.</li>

                    <li>The board is set up with the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The back rank (row) is filled with the player's pieces in the following order: rook,
                                knight,
                                bishop,
                                queen, king, bishop, knight, rook.</li>
                            <li>The front rank is filled with pawns.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Movement of Pieces: <ul>Each piece moves in a specific way: <ul>
                        <li>King: One square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
                        </li>
                        <li>Queen: Any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
                        </li>
                        <li>Rook: Any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                        <li>Bishop: Any number of squares diagonally.</li>
                        <li>Knight: Moves in an L-shape: two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction, and then one
                            square perpendicular to the first move.</li>
                        <li>Pawn: Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally one square forward. On its first
                            move,
                            it can move two squares forward. Pawns promote to other pieces if they reach the opposite
                            end of
                            the board.</li>

                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Capturing: <ul>
                    <li>To capture an opponent's piece, move your piece to the square occupied by the opponent's piece.
                        The
                        captured piece is removed from the board.</li>
                    <li>The king cannot be captured. Instead, the game ends when the king is under attack with no
                        possible
                        moves to avoid capture (checkmate).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Special Moves: <ul>
                    <li>Castling: The king can make a special move called castling with one of the rooks. It involves
                        moving
                        the king two squares towards the rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king.</li>
                    <li>En passant: If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an
                        opponent's pawn, the opponent can capture it as if it only moved one square forward.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Game Conclusion: <ul>
                    <li>The game ends when one player checkmates the opponent's king (placing it in a position where it
                        cannot avoid capture).</li>
                    <li>The game also ends in a draw if:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The position reaches a stalemate (the player whose turn it is has no legal move, but their
                            king
                            is not in check).
                        </li>
                        <li>The players agree to a draw.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is insufficient material to checkmate (e.g., king vs. king).
                        </li>
                        <li>Fifty moves pass without a pawn move or a piece capture.
                        </li>
                        <li>Threefold repetition occurs (the same position occurs three times with the same player to
                            move).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
