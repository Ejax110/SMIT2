        <dt>Our Masala Fries</dt>
        <dd>Our masala fries are a delightful appetizer that combines the crispy texture of perfectly fried potato
            strips with a tantalizing blend of aromatic spices. Each bite is a burst of flavor, as cumin, coriander, red
            chili powder, and turmeric create a harmonious symphony of taste. The addition of chaat masala adds a tangy
            and slightly tangy kick, elevating the overall experience. Whether enjoyed on their own or paired with a
            refreshing lemon wedge, our masala fries are a crowd-pleasing snack that will leave you craving more.</dd>
